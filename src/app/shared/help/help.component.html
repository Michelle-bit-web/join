    Welcome to the help page for <strong>Join</strong>, your guide to using our kanban project management tool.
    Here, we'll provide an overview of what Join is, how it can benefit you, and how to use it.
  </p>

  <section>
    <h2>What is Join?</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Join</strong> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of dedicated
      students as part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
      work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). Join leverages the principles of kanban to help users
      manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is important to note that Join is designed as an educational exercise and is not intended for extensive
      business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot guarantee consistent
      availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality regarding Join.

    <h2>How to use it</h2>
    <ol class="list">
      <li>
        <h3>1. Exploring the Board</h3>
        <p>
          In order to use the board, you need to log in first. You can either register or use the guest log in account. When you log in to Join, you'll find a default board. 
          This board represents your project and contains four default lists: <em>To Do</em>, <em>In Progress</em>, <em>Await feedback</em> and <em>Done</em>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>2. Creating Contacts</h3>
        <p>
          In Join, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the <strong>Contacts</strong> section,
          click on <strong>New contact</strong>, and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board. 
          If you are logged in with your personal account, you will find yourself as a contact within the contact list.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>3. Adding Cards</h3>
        <p>
          Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding new cards. Cards represent individual tasks. Click the
          "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details, like task
          name, description, due date, assignees, etc.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>4. Moving Cards</h3>
        <p>
          As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging and dropping the
          card from one list to another. On mobile devices each card has an additional menu option, where you can assign tasks to specific stages 
          in the board by clicking the "..." button.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>5. Deleting Cards</h3>
        <p>
          Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the <em>Done</em> list or delete it. Deleting a card will
          permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this action is
          irreversible.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Remember that using Join effectively requires consistent updates from you and your team to ensure the board
      reflects the current state of your project.
